    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you have ever worked on a web or mobile app, odds are you must have come across a scenario where you had to verify users' phone numbers by a text message or call. It could be for phone number verification or maybe for two-factor verification. Regardless of the use case, it would typically require you to use a service like <a href="http://www.twilio.com">Twilio</a> or <a href="http://www.nexmo.com">Nexmo</a>. This may not look like much as they offer simple, RESTful APIs, but it still takes some work getting it to work with your app.</p>

<p>Enter mOTP.</p>

<p><a href="http://motp.in">mOTP.in</a> is a free service which takes a fresh persective at this phone verification space. Instead of text messages or voice calls, mOTP uses the concept of missed calls to verify the user. I don&rsquo;t know how much missed calls have caught on in other countries but they have various uses in India, which is where mOTP hails from.</p>

<p>Anyway, what mOTP does is, it calls the user from a number like +NNNNNNNN where the numbers following the + sign represent the verification code. The call is disconnected with a second or less, just long enough to leave the evidence of a missed call. The advantage with this approach is it&rsquo;s free for the company as well as for the users.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know reliable it is, but it worked when I tried it. Give it a shot and let me know what you think in the comments.</p>
